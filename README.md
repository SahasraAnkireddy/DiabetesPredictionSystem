# DiabetesPredictionSystem
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict
whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements
included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of
these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are
females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.


# Project Description
This project presents a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes based on the analysis of diagnostic measurements. The dataset utilized is sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, specifically focusing on females aged at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The primary objective is to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes through the examination of various medical predictor variables.


# About the Dataset Used
The dataset encompasses critical health metrics, providing a comprehensive view for predictive analysis. The key variables include:

> Pregnancies

> Glucose

> Blood Pressure

> Skin Thickness

> Insulin

> BMI (Body Mass Index)

> Age

> Outcome: Target variable indicating diabetes presence (1) or absence (0)

# Results
The developed Diabetes Prediction System demonstrates promising accuracy and reliability in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes. The model's performance is assessed through rigorous evaluation metrics, providing insights into its strengths and areas for potential improvement.
